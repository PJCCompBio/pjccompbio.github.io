In our first session we will discuss "Linking transcriptional and genetic tumor heterogeneity through allele analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data" with first author Jean Fan, in this article Jean and collaborators develop HONEYBadger R package that can be used to identify alterations such as copy number variations in individual cancer cells from single-cell RNA sequencing data.
